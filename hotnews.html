	<h1>Record 39 runs in an over in T20Is: Why Samoan Darius Visser’s six sixes in an over needs to be celebrated despite small ground and a matting pitch</h1>
	<img src="https://media.tenor.com/9vd5OHQiqOEAAAAd/ace2king-cricket.gif">
<p>Four months ago, Darius Visser, a cricket coach in a Sydney club, decided to dust up his old dream of playing international cricket. He decided to make use of his mother’s Samoan heritage and took trials with Samoa’s team just before the East Asia Pacific region qualifiers for the T20 World Cup the year after. A batsman who bowls leg-spin—he began his cricket journey with Penrith Cricket Club, and aspired to be a fast bowler like the club’s most famous face, Pat Cummins, but for a spate of stress fractures—he breezed through the trials in time for the tournament.
</p>
<p><i>In only his third game, he wrote history by not only hitting six sixes in an over, but also set a record for most runs in an over 39, off the unfortunate Nalin Nipiko’s nine-ball over, against Vanuatu in Apia on Tuesday</i>.

With a hefty clump over fine-leg—all strikes arrived in the arc between fine-leg and midwicket —he joined an elusive and exclusive group. Only three batsmen have struck six sixes an over in T20Is ever, only seven others have managed the achievement in other forms of the game, in both domestic and international levels. <b>The list features both illustrious and obscure cricketers; it includes Gary Sobers and Ravi Shastri (both in first class), Herschelle Gibbs and Yuvraj Singh; it also features Ross Whitely and Jaskaran Malhotra</b>.</p>
